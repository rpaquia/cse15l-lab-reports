# Lab Report 5 Week 10
The following tests were made by running the `bash script.sh > results.txt` command in **ieng6** on both the markdown-parse implementation from lab 9 and from my lab group. I then used the command `diff markdown-parse-lab9/results.txt markdown-parse/results.txt` in order to compare the results files of both the lab 9's markdown-parse and my group's markdown-parse. 

## Test 1: 194.md

The top image is the comparison between my group's implementation and the professor's implementation. The top input represents the professor's while the bottom is my group's.
